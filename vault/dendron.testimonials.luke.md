> Hierarchies [are] such a game changer, and is simultaneously what put me off trying Dendron (I really wanted to try the "flat hierarchy with just links" concept) and later drew me in again. I just couldn't organise myself with a flat structure and ended up spreading notes out.
I think the key thing that changed my perspective was the ease of restructuring hierarchies, it gives you the confidence to just write, safe in the knowledge that you can just restructure it later

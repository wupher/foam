# Changelog

## [0.13.4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.4-alpha.1...v0.13.4) (2020-10-28)

### Features

#### Migrate Existing Workspaces to Server Mode 
- commit ([d19b6ec](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d19b6ecb97fb60d8706e14f0181795113b5e108b))

This is the last phase in Dendron's server mode migration. All new workspaces are already running in server mode as well as well as users that have opted into it. This update transparently migrates remaining workspaces to server mode. 

As a reminder, [[server mode|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] is a re-architecture of Dendron that enables both better performance and a vast array of new features. 

Finally, we do have an escape valve in things something goes terribly wrong. You can set the following option to revert server mode behavior. If you end up using this, please also cut as [a ticket]( https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or a message in [discord](https://discord.gg/QbKsNx).

### House Cleaning

#### Dendron: Change Workspace will no longer create a workspace if no workspace exists

Previously, if you wanted to use an existing folder (aka vault) with a workspace, we recommended you run `Change Workspace` which would create a Dendron workspace **inside** the folder if it didn't exist. This turns out to be an anti-pattern that interferes with features like publishing which expect the workspace to be in a separate folder from its vaults.

If you've used `Change Workspace` to bootstrap existing files, we recommend using the following guide to migrate your notes to a new workspace. 

((ref: [[dendron.cook]]#use dendron with a current folder:#*))

## [0.12.10](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.10-alpha.4...v0.12.10) (2020-10-16)

### Features

#### Rename and Refactor Commands an Order of Magnitude Faster Now (server mode) 🚀🚀🚀

These commands have been completely re-written and use a proper markdown parser to find links (vs many fragile regex statements). 
The re-write results in both much faster performance as well as a more correct implementation. 

### Enhancements

### Features

#### Human Friendly Timestamps (server mode)

Timestamps now have human friendly decorators on the side.

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/daily.ts.jpg)

### Enhancements

- **copyAssets configuration**: when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not
- **dump state**: dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)

### Bug Fixes
- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set
- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error
- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps

## [0.12.8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.8-alpha.2...v0.12.8) (2020-10-14)

### Features

#### Really update time in frontmatter (server only)

Dendron notes have frontmatter with an **updated** field. This field is supposed to show you the time in milliseconds of when the document was last updated. Until today's update, this field did not actually change  😅

```
id: 65b03213-d3d1-46c0-9881-a6280ed9bdeb
title: New
desc: ''
updated: 1602096212957
created: 1602096212957
```

Today's update makes **updated** update!

## [0.12.7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.7-alpha.10...v0.12.7) (2020-10-13)

### Features

#### (Local) Server Side Indexing

Dendron can now index and manage your notes as a standalone **local** server independent from VSCode. 

This is part of the [[server migration milestone|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] which we took on for October. 

Dendron's server side indexing is a **complete rewrite** of the [[Dendron engine|dendron.dev.design.engine]] which powers Dendron's lookup capabilities. The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).

Server site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:

- [[multi-vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]
- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing
- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)
- realtime updates for graph extensions
- custom dendron extensions written in any language 

Server side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.

```json
"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport": true
```

Note that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:
- RenameNote
- Refactor Hierarchy
- Archive Hierarchy
- Realtime Schema Updates
- Pod Commands

You can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. 

### Enhancements
- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))
- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion
- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration
- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults
- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter

### Bug Fixes
- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs
- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases
- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON

### Breaking Changes
- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut
- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut

### Progress

#### Server Migration

These past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.

### Features

#### Create scratch or journal notes via lookup

A journal note is a self contained note that is meant to track something over time. Examples of journals include recording **workout sessions**, making **meeting notes**, and keeping a **mood journal**.

To create a journal note, trigger a lookup and then click on the calendar icon.

<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/3c3ddc1dc63547cea8bf186bec31f71b"> 
<img style="" src="https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/3c3ddc1dc63547cea8bf186bec31f71b-with-play.gif"> </a>

A scratch note is a self contained note that is meant to be used as scratchpad. Use it for thoughts or when you want to expand on a bullet point. Scratch notes are created in the `scratch` domain and have the following format: `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD-HHHHmmss}`.

# 2020-10-25 Release Notes (version 0.14)

## Highlights
- server mode enabled for all users
- generate a table of contents when publishing your notes
    - it's like a hiearchy but INSIDE your note
- publishing your notes to different formats using pods     
    - you can have any format as long as its JSON and markdown
- realtime schema validation 
    - because finding YAML errors is better when its in realtime
- schema templates now set note frontmatter and content
    - we are procrastinating on finishing the graphical schema editor so we're releasing other schema features in the meantime
- lookup supports direct child filter
    - because having too many children can be lots of work
- many bug fixes related to lookup and refactoring notes
    - if a bug was found in the forest and no one reported it, was it really a bug?

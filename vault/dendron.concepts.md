## Concepts

Below are some concepts that are helpful to know when using Dendron. Note that features with ðŸš§ are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.

### Markdown

Dendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a convenient way of adding extra information to your documents like a shorthand title or longer description (think any extra information you can use to describe a note). This type of information is generally called metadata and the structure used is called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can add it to the front of your markdown file and it won't show up in the preview. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). 

You can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here |dendron.topic.frontmatter]]

### Workspace
In Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`.

### Vaults ðŸš§
Your workspace is made up of **vaults**. A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a *vaults* folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    â”œâ”€â”€ vault.main
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.md
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.one.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ foo.two.md
    â””â”€â”€ vault.secret (hypothetical)
        â”œâ”€â”€ secret.one.md
        â””â”€â”€ secret.two.md
```

By default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.

### Hierarchies

((ref:[[dendron.topic.hierarchies]]#Hierarchies,1:#Concepts))

You can read more about hierarchies [[here|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]

### Domain

A domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.


```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.promotion.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.legal.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.task1.md
â””â”€â”€ project1.tasks.task2.md
```

### Schema  

As you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. 

You can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. 

Below is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`

```yml
- id: cli
  desc: command line interface reference
  parent: root
  namespace: true
  children:
    - cmd
    - env
- id: env
  desc: variables relevant for command
- id: cmd
  desc: subcommands 
  namespace: true
```

### Pods ðŸš§

[[Pods |dendron.topic.pod]] are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. 


### Command Bar

The command bar is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar.

- <img src="https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico" width=16 height=16/> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf">macOS</a> `Cmd+Shift+P`
- <img src="https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico" width=16 height=16/> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">Windows</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`


### Lookup Bar

The lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Bar` or use the `Ctrl+L` shortcut.

# KK's birthday Advices

KK 2022 年生日的 birthday Advice，共 103 条，我挑选了自己喜欢的若干条整理如下：

## 思想

- 永远不要为你不想成为的人工作。 Don't ever work for someone you don't want to become.

- 培养 12 个爱你的人，而不是 120 万喜欢你的人。Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.

- 不要犯同样的错，犯新的错误。Don't keep making the same mistakes, try to make new mistakes.

- 当你原谅别人，别人并不会知道，但你会被治愈。原谅不是我们为别人做什么，而是送给自己的礼物。When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.

- 当出现两方争吵的时候，寻找第三方。Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.

- 效率被高估了，休息被严重低估了。没有良好的休息，不可能有高效率。Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.

- 你真正的领导任务是培养下一个领导者，而不是跟随者。When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.

- If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.

- 不要追求更好的方法来尽快完成任务，而要追求更好的任务，让你做得不想停下来。Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.

- The biggest lie we tell ourselves is "I don't need to write this down because I will remember it."

- The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.

- You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.

- For the best results with your children, spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

- Don’t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.

- Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.

- A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.

- When you have some success, the feeling of being an imposter can be real. Who am I fooling? But when you create things that only you — with your unique talents and experience — can do, then you are absolutely not an imposter. You are the ordained. It is your duty to work on things that only you can do.

- What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.

- 90% of everything is crap. If you think you don’t like opera, romance novels, TikTok, country music, vegan food, NFTs, keep trying to see if you can find the 10% that is not crap.

- Your best job will be one that you were unqualified for because it stretches you. In fact only apply to jobs you are unqualified for.

- 回答"我要做什么？"，需要先回答"我要成为谁？"。The only productive way to answer “what should I do now?” is to first tackle the question of “who should I become?”

- It’s thrilling to be extremely polite to rude strangers.

-Don't bother fighting the old; just build the new.

- You are as big as the things that make you angry.

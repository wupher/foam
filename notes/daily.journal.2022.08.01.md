## How to Lose Time And Money

- 源文: http://www.paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html

> In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an investment."

> A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.

## What's fun?

玩了一周末的 “Dying Light" 我没有觉得疲劳，难受。然后一到单位，我就觉得眼睛难受，犯困。是这样的光线吗？是所做的内容吗？也许我应该安排一下证明和测试。

可能原因：

- 心情
- 环境灯光
- 睡眠

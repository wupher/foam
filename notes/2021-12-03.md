### 写作技巧

巴菲特每年会写一封股东信，解释过去一年的投资思路。据说，他的做法是先写给他的妹妹多萝西，写完后再把多萝西的名字替换为"股东"。
向大量读者写作的一个窍门，就是改成向一个熟人写作。

所以我要写，就得当成是给我儿子写。我不是占便宜，而是这样就会更耐心。

### 3-2-1

"When considering a new project or opportunity, one of the first questions to ask is, “How do I want to spend my days?”

Make as few choices as possible that violate your answer.

Many opportunities seem exciting but actually give you less of the life you want."

你想过什么样子的日子。然后再据此列出计划。

"If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we are not really living.

Growth demands a temporary surrender of security. It may mean a giving up of familiar but limiting patterns, safe but unrewarding work, values no longer believed in, relationships that have lost their meaning.

As Dostoevsky put it, "Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most." The real fear should be of the opposite course."
